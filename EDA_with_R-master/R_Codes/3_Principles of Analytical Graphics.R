## Principles of Analytics Graphics 
#-----------------------------------

# One should read the book of "Edward Tufte's" wonderful book Beautiful Evidence
# This book discusses how to make informative and useful data graphics and lays out six principles that are important to achieving the goal

#1. Show Comparisons
#-------------------

# - Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing Hypothesis
# - Always ask "Compared to what ?"
#e.g. If we compare effect of air cleaner on the people having Asthma with respect to having no air cleaner


#2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
#---------------------------------------------------------------
# - What is your casual framework for thinking about a question ?
# - So you are making some thinking 

# We can make another plot which tell us that the fine particular matter is decreased when we used air cleaner so we can say that 
# it helps to have more symptom free days

#3. Show Multivariate Data
#-------------------------
# The real world is multivariate
# Need to "escape flatland"

# e.g. First we plot the Daily Mortality w.r.t PM10 Concentration in different season


#4. Integration of Words
#-----------------------

# - Completely integrate words, numbers, images,diagrams
# - Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
# - Don't let the tool drive the analysis

#5. Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources etc.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

#6. Content is king
#-------------------
# Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relavance and integrity of their content
